# GQWTest
Test Project for GQW
Author: Octavio LÃ³pez
This repository contains the Unity project for my GQW programmer test.

Gameplay:
Defense your central tower by destroying the upcoming enemies. To attack them point your finger(or mouse) to deploy a killer beam. While you focus your beam, you can also drag your defense towers as an extra strategy. Destroy as many enemies as you can before your run out of HP.

Builds:
The project works on both Windows and Android. For building just change the building target for Windows or Android and then build.
